 The files listed are complete but they are only a small portion of this project. This will be a full stack application.
 The files listed in this repository include a small but very capable BACK-END using MongoDB! Also the client and server 
 files. Usinf an NPM module @cuncurrently to run both client and server instances with a single command. Very convienient 
 as it assigned --PORT:5000 for our Mongo Database and --PORT:3000-- for the client-side server running the @nodemon module.
 We were then able to focus on providing functionality to our code using React and Bootstrap. Also we used the @'uuid' module 
 for assigning our ListItems their own unique <id>. This is the largest app that I've ever had the pleasure of working on. A lot
 of "moving parts" so to speak. It was part of a tutorial taught by @bradtraversy on his Youtube channel.
